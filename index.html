            <p>Capturing life's most precious moments has been my passion since 2018. I have had professional training and posing experience for many years and it is important to me that I am constantly learning and growing in order to provide the absolute best client experience.
            I have been given the opportunity of photographing many families, engagements, seniors, weddings, and events. Some of the most special people I have provided images for were Miss America 2020, Netflixâ€™s Dan Schneider, and NFL player, Ken Oxendine.
            I have been awarded the Richmond Times Dispatch title of "Best Local Photographer" for 2022 which I call my greatest accomplishment.
            My goal is to not only provide you with images that will last a lifetime but make the process fun and easy.</p>

	<!-- Testimonial -->
	<p>Megan was absolutely INCREDIBLE. She was SO flexible and understanding when it came to rain on our shoot day and she even sacrificed her own personal time to make sure we were satisfied and happy. Not to mention, her pictures, angles, and coloring are undeniably so beautiful, and I was completely blown away by our gallery, not to mention how QUICK she got it done. I could go on for days about how well her customer service is and how much talent she has. You 100% will NOT regret booking her!</p>
