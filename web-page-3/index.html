            <!-- About me -->
            <p>Capturing life's most precious moments has been my passion since 2018. I have had professional training and posing experience for many years and it is important to me that I am constantly learning and growing in order to provide the absolute best client experience.
            I have been given the opportunity of photographing many families, engagements, seniors, weddings, and events. Some of the most special people I have provided images for were Miss America 2020, Netflixâ€™s Dan Schneider, and NFL player, Ken Oxendine.
            I have been awarded the Richmond Times Dispatch title of "Best Local Photographer" for 2022 which I call my greatest accomplishment.
            My goal is to not only provide you with images that will last a lifetime but make the process fun and easy.</p>
